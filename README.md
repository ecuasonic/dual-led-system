# Dual LED Lighting System with Adjustable Intensity

This project implements a dual LED lighting system with adjustable intensity and color temperature, controlled by two input switches. It utilizes two LEDsâ€”one cool white and one yellow to create customizable ambient lighting conditions.<br>

Implemented in:
- Physical wiring circuit
- FPGA (vhdl)

## Features

- **Cool White LED** and **Yellow LED** for adjustable color temperature.
- **Two Input Switches** to control light intensity and color combinations.
- **Dynamic Lighting Modes** based on switch combinations:
  - **No switches on**: Cool white LED at 50% intensity.
  - **Left switch on**: Both LEDs at 50% intensity.
  - **Right switch on**: Cool white LED at 100% intensity, yellow LED at 50%.
  - **Both switches on**: Both LEDs at 100% intensity.

## Lighting Modes Summary

| Left Switch | Right Switch | Cool White LED Intensity | Yellow LED Intensity |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| Off         | Off          | 50%                      | 0%                    |
| On          | Off          | 50%                      | 50%                   |
| Off         | On           | 100%                     | 50%                   |
| On          | On           | 100%                     | 100%                  |

## UML State Diagram

## Transition Table

![transition-table](images/transition-table.png)

Transition table that describes the dual-LED system, which is a Moore state machine. <br>
This table will be used to derive Boolean expressions to be implemented in a breadboard prototype. <br>
Q1 and Q0 represent the current state, whereas Q1+ and Q0+ represent the next state.<br>

## Boolean Equations

From the transition table, a K-Map was performed to derive the following boolean equations. <br>
`CW = Q0 + Q1`
`Y = Q1`
`Q1+ = (L * R) + (Q0 * R) + (~Q1 * L)`
`Q2+ = ~L * ~Q0`
